# Sum calcutor on Arduino through push buttons, 7 segments display and LEDs

The circuit will have two push button buttons. 

- The first button will be used to enter the numbers to be added incrementally (0 to 3;
- The second button will serve as "Enter";
- The 7-segment display will show the numbers to be entered. When the first number is entered, Enter must be pressed to store it in memory;
- Then the display will be reset;
- The second number will be provided and Enter will be pressed for the sum to be made;
- The result of the sum will appear in binary on the three leds. 

When pressing Enter again, the display will be reset and the LEDs off, for a new sum to be made.
